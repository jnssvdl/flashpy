## Installation

To run the program and modify the source code, follow these steps:

1. Download and install the required modules:

   - Install the `customtkinter` module, which is used for the GUI, by running the following command in the terminal:

     ```bash
     pip3 install customtkinter
     ```

     **Note: It is recommended to update the module regularly as it is under active development. You can use the following command to upgrade the module:**

     ```bash
     pip3 install customtkinter --upgrade
     ```

   - Install the `CTkMessagebox` module, which is used for message boxes, by running the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install CTkMessagebox
     ```

2. *(Optional)* Install the Montserrat font:

   To fully experience the intended theme, it is recommended to install the Montserrat font on your device. Here's how:

   - Download the font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) by visiting the provided link.
   - Click on the "Download family" button.
   - Once downloaded, unzip the file.
   - Locate the `Montserrat-VariableFont_wght` and `Montserrat-Italic-VariableFont_wght` files and double-click on each.
   - Click the "Install" button for both files to install the font on your device.
   - Congratulations! You now have the Montserrat font installed.

Now you are ready to run the program and modify the source code. If you prefer to only run the program, you can download the main application with the .exe file and run it directly. However, it is still recommended to download the Montserrat font to fully experience the intended theme.
